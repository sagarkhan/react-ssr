## Run/Build the application

- Create a .env file in project root directory with following configurations.

```
  AURA_ENV=production | development | uat
  RUNTIME=LOCAL | LIVE
  CORS=false  /* Enable domain restriction, ALLOWED_ORIGINS needs to be whitelisted in constants.js */
```

- Open terminal window and install npm dependencies by running
  `npm install`

- Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` the application will start in a new browser window at `localhost:3000`

- Run `form.html` file from project root directory, it contains a form to create a new session.

- Fill the entries in the `form.html` and submit. The application will start on `localhost:3000`.

- To build the project in production mode run `npm run build`. The build files will generate inside `\build` directory at project root.

- To start the production build run `npm run start:prod`. Open `localhost:3000` in the browser window.

- Note:- For the simplicity of development, performance enhancements like compression, caching, minification, uglification etc will occur only in production mode.

## Coding standards

Following are the coding standards that one must follow while working on this boilerplate.

- Mandatory to follow AirBnB [AirBnB coding standards](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md)

- JS Linting before every commit `npm run lint`. AirBnB lint configurations are already loaded.

- Do not modify linter rules without consulting.

- Follow 2 space indentation rule. Install `ext install EditorConfig.EditorConfig` VS Code plugin. The `.editorconfig` in project root dir will overwite default indentation settings of VS code to meet project standards.

- HOC patterns at places where necessary e.g. Login and authentication

- ES6 use destructor or optional chaining pattern wherever possible and use ES6 as a standard everywhere possible

- All external urlâ€™s and configurations should be env based.

- All api responses should be wrapped and referenced in the frontend

- Use propTypes and defaultProps for specifying props meta in all components. This will reduce `undefined` errors.

- Use React 16 concepts, Context API, Hooks etc wherever possible

- Have discussion before putting stuff to redux store keep a store document do not overuse REDUX.

- Do not mix and match local state and redux state keep a single source fo truth.

- Use containerized and clean architecture. Look at the example container in this boilerplate.

- Consult before installing any new npm packages.

- Use only camelCase variable names do not mix with underscore names, For constants name use uppercase and underscore.

- Avoid using and 3rd party css library and based on timelines avoid even using any component library. React Material Ui is fine based on the use case.

- Scss -> Use a global scss file to define all common and global css and import and override at the component level.

- Only theming properties should be written in resources.scss file. (scss mixins, variables etc)

- Strictly follow BEM css/scss standards for all styles.

- **IMPORTANT:-** Do not modify the contents of following directories without consulting.

  > /bin

  > /config

  > /scripts

This is where the entire magic happens modifying anything here without knowing can lead to build errors.

## Project Structure

The enitre applcation code and logic should be inside `/src` dir

- Directory structure of `/src/client`

  > /assets

  > /components

  > /environments

  > /hoc

  > /app

  > /services

  > /store

  > /utils

- All the images, icons, fonts and external assets should be kept inside `/assets` directory.

- Application level shared component should be written inside `/components` directory.

- Different enviornment configurations `['dev', 'qa', 'prod']` should be kept inside `/environments` directory in their respective files and env should be loaded from `.env` file. See the example in the boilerplate.

- `/hoc` directory is for keeping application level layouts

- `/app` directory is where your entire application logic will be written. All the containers,components,routes will be added inside this directory. See the example in the boilerplate.

- All the API calls in your app should be added `/services` directory. **_Component should never directly make an API call instead it should load the respective service and handle HTTP requests_**.

- Redux reducers, actions and store configurations should be added in `/store` directory.

- Utility functions should be written inside utils.

## Features

- Server Side Rendering Capabilities.
- Ease of code same as other React CSR applications.
- Scss modules, Scss resource sharing support.
- Quality linting and formatting using AirBnB lint & prettier formatter.
- Compression enabled brotli & gzip.
- Lazy loading components enabled.
- Optional Chaining.
- Enable/Disable CORS restriction.
- SSR Session validation. (can be toggled in environments.js)

### Credits

This boilerplate was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) and modified to achieve scss support, code splitting, service worker capabilities, build compression and many other optimization enhancements.
